title: 8StarLabs UI
description: Introduction
---

8StarLabs UI is a specialized component library that goes beyond the basics. While most component libraries focus on common UI elements like buttons and forms, we create **niche, purpose-built components** that solve real-world problems you won't find elsewhere. It is a custom registry built on top of shadcn/ui to help you build beautiful frontend experiences faster.

Components are available via the `npx shadcn@latest add` command.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.8starlabs.io/r/<component>.json
```

For example, to install the Status Indicator component, you can run:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.8starlabs.io/r/status-indicator.json
```

## Designed to Complement, Not Replace

8StarLabs UI is not intended to replace the beautiful component libraries you're already using. Instead, we're designed to complement your existing toolkit by providing specialized components that aren't commonly found elsewhere.

We recommend using 8StarLabs UI alongside your core component library - whether that's shadcn/ui, 8bitcn, magicui or any other library you prefer. Use their components for buttons, forms, and layouts, then enhance your application with our niche components for specific use cases like transport badges, specialized status indicators, and domain-specific widgets.

Think of us as the specialized tools in your workshop - you still need your hammer and screwdriver, but sometimes you need that specific tool that makes a particular job much easier.
